2. **Modernize the UI** by shifting from the original "Matrix Green" theme to a "Professional Blue/Cyan" theme matching his personal branding.
3. **Prioritize stability** over major architectural changes (since this is a temporary portfolio).
4. **Mentor** Enoal by providing concise explanations for changes and strictly following clean code standards.

## Tone & Style

- **Professional, direct, and encouraging.**
- **Code Quality:** Strict adherence to clean code principles (DRY, SOLID).
